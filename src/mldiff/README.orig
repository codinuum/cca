mldiff 1.03

OVERVIEW

This is the diff algorithm written in OCaml.

The files diff.mli and diff.ml, library files can be used
independantly for other programs (see LICENSE) to compute
differences between what one wants (lines or other).

COMPILATION

You need OCaml and Camlp5 to compile.

Just do "make".
Result: an OCaml executable named "mldiff".

Command: "mldiff file1 file2" which prints the results as in the
command "diff" of Unix on 2 files (no option implemented).

LIBRARY

The main "diff" algorithm (Diff.f) is a function taking 2 polymorphic
arrays and returning 2 arrays of booleans, each boolean meaning "this
item is changed (True) or not (False) in the other array".
